Explain how to find the maximal margin hyperplane for a data set.
Use a graph of a support vector classifier and its margins to identify which points are support vectors.
Explain how the cost affects the margin size, bias, and variance of a support vector classifier.
Create a support vector classifier in R, plot it, and use it to classify points in the training data.
Choose an optimal cost value using cross-validation in R.
Understand the optimization problem involved in finding the maximal margin hyperplane.
Explain how to generalize support vector classifiers for data with non-linear boundaries between categories.
Explain how kernels make support vector machines computationally feasible.
Use a SVM with a radial kernel in R.
Choose among different kernels and classification methods for a given data set.
